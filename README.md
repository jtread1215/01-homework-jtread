# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
This project's intent was to take a good website to a great website in the terms of accessibility and semantics. 
I did not change any of the appearances of the website but made some tweaks in the CSS and HTML to make it easier to see the source code.
There were many challenges that occurred but once I broke the site down by each section it got easier to fix and understand.
